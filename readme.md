# C# Programming Language
	- Type Systeme with Support for Conversion
		- Value Types
			- Numeric
				- byte (1),short(2),int(4),long(8)
				- float(4), double(8)
				- decimal(16)
			- Boolean
				- bool(1)
			- Character
				- char(2)
			- Nullable Representation for type
				- Establish a bridge between C# code and database column type definitions to prevent runt-time exception
				- Value Types can be nullable
					- int? x;
						- x can have null value
		- Reference Types
			- String
				- Class for string operation
				- C# 9.0+ as nullable string
					- string? str; 
			- Collections
			- Delegates and Events
			- Classs
				- Foundation of OOPs
					- Class contains Members
						- Data Members, fields
						- Properties
						- methods
						- events
					- Access Speicfiers
						- private (default for Class members)
						- public, accessible everywhere
						- protected, accessible only in derived class
						- internal, default for class, accessible with a namespace in assembly
							- The namespace is collection of classes
						- protected internal
							- Accessible with a namespace in all derived classed also derived classed in other assembly
						- Access Modifiers
							- Define a behavior of class and its members
							- abstract
								- When applied on class, it cannot be instantiated
								- When applied on methods, the methos must be overriden in derived class
							- sealed
								- When applied on class, it cannot be derived
								- When applied on method, it canot be overriden		- static
								- The Class members are directly accessible w/o instance
							- virtual
								- Used to define a method with a default implmentation, it many be overriden by method in derived class or can be used as it is 
							- override
								- Used to override an abstract and vitrual methods 
				- Beginning of Domain-Driven-Development
					- Class 
						- Class with public properties only
							- An Entity class /  DTO
						- Class with Logic Method known as Business class or Domain class
					- Make sure that the class has all method targetted or scope to a specfic responsiblility (Single-Responsibility-Principal)
						- e.g. If created a class for Employee Opetrations, then each method of the class MUST contains logic around employee operations e.g. Read/Write		
				- For a method each value type paramerter will be having values stored in differnt memory locations, pass by value
					- For reference pass used 'ref' or 'out'
						- the 'ref' must be having initial values before passing to method
						- the 'out' must change values inside the method, the caller need not have an initial value for the 'out' variable

# C# Project with .NET 6+
	- Implict Main() method
	- Microsoft.NETCore.App
		- An assembly containing all Standard .NET Libraries those are used tobuild and run the application 
	- Single File Publish with The Compression of dependencies for XCopy or easy deployment
